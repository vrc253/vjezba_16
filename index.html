        While there are plenty of variations in the AP Royal Oak collection, the watches (barring a few exceptions) all share the following defining design characteristics.
        Octagonal bezel, which gives the Royal Oak its bold and recognizable look
        Eight hexagonal-shaped screws in the bezel
        A hobnail patterned (also known as Clous de Paris) dial, which the brand calls a Tapisserie dial. There are different sized patterns, classified as Petite Tapisserie, Grande Tapisserie, and Méga Tapisserie
        Integrated bracelet, which transitions seamlessly from the case.
